==============================================

This is a demo educational web ui application that can be deployed into Cloud Foundry. Home page is on the / path, and there's a /manage path that can do basic management of "members."

You can manage the members in the /manage page. You will be able to add and delete members from the program.

Still to be done:
1 - URL to backend is hardcoded.
2 - Retrieving the list of members.
3 - Only works in Chrome.

Known issues:
1 - There's limited connections allowed from the backend to the database. As a result, add/delete/retrieve results can fail.
